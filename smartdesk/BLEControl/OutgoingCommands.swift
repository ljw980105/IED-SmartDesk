 * A caseless enum that holds all commands sent to the Arduino.
 *  - Make sure there are no duplicates
 *  - As of now the program should only send one character (one byte) at a time
 * for speed purposes. It's a little problematic to send multiple characters
 * at once because Arduino's `readString()` method which reads multi chars is slow
